      <h4>Story time</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>That time I was blocked on a simple problem</strong> <br>
        My function was incorrectly returning an array (a collection of data, each item separated by commas) where
        each piece of data was unknown/undefined.
        <br>
        I trialed my code by outputting the problem array at every step throughout my code logic so I could track where
        it was going wrong using console.log. I didn't spend time in understanding the error message of 'undefined', and
        I felt like the
        way
        I'd written my code was correct to the point I would run my code multiple times in disbelief that I was still
        getting it wrong!
        <br>
        After tracking my code throughout each step of my logic, it became clear that the code which outputs my solution
        needed to be assigned to a variable name and then called upon.
        <br> I've learnt for next time to read an understand the error message your computer is providing, because it's
        literally telling you what is wrong and where it's going wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>That time a elegantly solved a problem</strong>
        <br>
        There was a challenge which required me remove all odd numbers from a collection of data. This problem was
        elegantly solved because: <br>
        1. I used a method called .filter which achieves the same output as using another method but using less code
        <br>
        2. Short-hand function terminology was used which cuts out extra lines of code<br>
        3. The smarts of my code within the function was written out using (I believe) as little code as possible
        <br>
        <br>
        This made me feel awesome because not only was I grasping the challenge and understanding the process in
        achieving the desired output, but writing precise code without any fluff.

      <h4>Problem solving techniques</h4>

      These are the steps I take in order to solve a problem, using recommended techniques: <br>

      <ol>
        <li>Read the question and understand it</li>
        <li>Break down the question in laymans terms using <strong>Pseudocode</strong>, with each comment line
          representing a chunk of
          code to write. This allows you to break down a big scary question into manageable bite size peices
        </li>
        <li>Under each comment, write your code and <strong>try something</strong> so it achieves what you've spelled
          out in your pseudocode. Remember
          you're only trying to achieve the desired output, the code doesn't need to be elegant, it just needs to work.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter a situation where you understand the output but don't have the method required memorised in
          your toolkit, <strong>Google</strong> what you're trying to achieve and see whether there is an inbuilt method
          you can utilise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generally at this stage you're 90% there and you can't figure out the last steps to tie out your code to
          complete the
          question. In this instance use <strong>console logging</strong>. Console log your inputs throughout the start,
          middle and end
          of your
          function so you can understand what the output of your function is achieiving throughout your code. You will
          often find minor mistakes to the syntax of your code which will get you across the line!
        </li>
        <li>
          If console logging doesn't work and Google doesn't help, time to ask your <strong>peers or coaches</strong>
          for help so they can guide you
          through the problem and act as a sounding board as you talk them through your logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you've successfully answered the question, <strong>improve your process with reflection</strong>, go
          through your completed code and see whether there is a way to enhance, simplify or improve the readability.
        </li>
      </ol>
