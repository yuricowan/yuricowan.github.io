          <strong>An analogy to describe JavaScript and the differences between HTML and CSS
          </strong><br><br>
          JavaScript is a wizard that performs magic. The wizard works its magic having the ability to change how you
          view
          a webpage based on your interactions with it. Its spells can change the colour, position, remove and add
          content
          on a webpage, including storing information behind the scenes.
        </p>

          <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</strong><br><br>
          Control flow is the sequence of actions you go through to complete a task. The sequence of actions must be in
          order otherwise you won’t arrive at the tasks desired outcome. If you're shampooing your hair, you’ll need to
          apply shampoo, scrub your hair and rinse. If you mess up that order, you’re in trouble! For example if you
          rinse
          your hair, scrub your hair and then apply shampoo then you’re not properly shampooing your hair.
          <br><br>
          Loops are iterative and performs a certain task during each repetition. It’s kinda like hammering a nail into
          the wall. You need to hit the nail on the head with a hammer multiple times and after each hit the nail moves
          further into the wall, and once the nails all the way in, there’s no more hammering!

          <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
          </strong><br><br>
          Arrays hold a list of information, each piece of information has a number associated with it called an index
          number. An array is a single variable, and can be added to objects as attributes.
          <br><br>
          Objects hold information (key value pairs) inside their attributes. Objects can have
          multiple attributes with values, which give the object its make-up, for example the 'car' object may have the
          attributes
          of
          brand: Toyota, color: blue, model: Corolla and milage: 156,000. The objects attributes can be stored as
          numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and
          more. To
          access an object you can call the objects name and it will return everything there is to know about the
          object,
          or you can call specific attributes of the object by calling the object.attribute. <br><br><img

          <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</strong><br><br>
          Functions contain snippets of code that complete a certain task. The beauty of functions is that it
          prevents you from having to duplicate your code instead
          you call the functions name whenever you want the tasks inside it to be executed.

          <strong>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</strong><br><br>
          The DOM (Document Object Model) sees your webpage as a family-tree like structure, with each branch
          representing a part of your webpage. This structure allows the user to manipulate the content, look and
          structure of a
          website
          using JavaScript. You can interact with it using commands that identify parts of the website
          you're wanting to manipulate. This can be done by selecting html #ids, classes or elements and more!

          <br>Eg document.getElementById('myContent').style.color = "blue";
