        <strong>An analogy to describe JavaScript the differences between HTML and CSS
        </strong><br><br>
        JavaScript is a wizard that performs magic. The wizard works its magic having the ability to change how you view
        a webpage based on your interactions with it. Its spells can change the colour, position, remove and add content
        on a webpage, including storing information.

        <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</strong><br><br>
        Control flow is the sequence of actions you go through to complete a task. The sequence of actions must be in
        order otherwise you won’t arrive at the tasks desired outcome. If you need to shampoo your hair, you’ll need to
        apply shampoo, scrub your hair and rinse. If you mess up that order, you’re in trouble! For example if you rinse
        your hair, scrub your hair and then apply shampoo then you’re not properly shampooing your hair.
        <br>
        Loops are iterative, which achieves a certain task during each repetition. It’s kinda like hammering a nail into
        the wall. You need to hit the nail on the head with a hammer multiple times and after each hit the nail moves
        further into the wall, and once the nails all the way in, there’s no more hammering!

        <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </strong><br><br>
        Arrays hold bits of information, each piece of information has a number associated with it called an index
        number. To access a certain bit of information you call the array and its corresponding index number.
        <br><br> <img alt="arrayExample" src="/images/arrayImg.png">
        Where as objects hold information about the said object, however you can become detailed and give your object
        multiple attributes. The objects attributes can be stored as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and more. To
        access an object you can call the objects name and it will return everything there is to know about the object,
        or you can call specific attributes off the object. <br><img alt="objectExample" src="/images/objectImg.png">
