        <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the
          values
          involved
          in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</strong>

        Early this year I had decided to change careers from accounting and move into software development, I had put
        through my initial application into Dev-Academy while still being employed.
        I had to decide whether to tell my current employer that I was seeking to change careers without any guarentee
        that I had been accepted into the course. I knew if I told my employer late,
        not only would it impact his ability to hire someone new in time but it would leave a number of client
        businesses at risk of not being supported by their accountant/virtual CFO, and tarnish my relationship with my
        manager and teammates.
        I decided to be open and tell my employer of my intentions and kept an open dialog that nothing was set in stone
        as I hadn't been accepted into the course.
        They were appreciative that I was open and honest, it gave them time to consider the team structure and have
        time to hire before my departure.

        My parents sacraficed a lot to raise myself and my siblings, my mother raised the kids and my father worked to
        make an income.
        Through my upbringing commitment, persaverence, hard-work and doing the-right-thing were values I observed from
        my parents which are
        ingrained into my identity and values.

        <strong>Friends feedback in their words:</strong> <br>Yuri’s key strength is having a can-do attitude. This is
        shown through his
        ability to put
        his mind to certain tasks and work through a process to achieve his desired outcome.
        <br>Yuri’s greatest weakness is that he can become obsessed with the tasks aforementioned which lead to the
        detriment of other parts of his life.
        <br> Yuri is a funny, relaxed person who you can always count on to get stuff done

        Being persistent with learning new concepts and logical with problem solving.

      <p> <strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but
          there was
          resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
          reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong>

        There were several group projects at university where members of the team wouldn't participate and often would
        be unable to commit to meeting as a group to work on the assignment.
        I tried communicating to the team member whether there was anything I could help with which would mean they
        could attend meet-ups and commit to a shared deadline. If that didn't work I
        gave the course instructor a heads-up about my situation and asked for guidance.
