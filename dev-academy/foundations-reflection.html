        <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core
          learning?</strong><br><br>

        1. I’ve become more aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I think we’re subconsciously aware of our strengths
        and
        weaknesses, however spending time to research, and receive feedback from close friends clearly identifies them
        and paints a clearer picture
        <br>
        2. I have a growth mindset! It’s encouraging to read about growth mindsets and the benefits of thinking in a
        particular way when you already actively practice it.
        <br>
        3. Being kinder to yourself. I’m learning new skills quickly even though it might not seem like you’ve achieved
        much over a day, when you zoom out and look at the whole journey and compare your skills to when you started,
        it’s impressive to recognise how much you’ve improved.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br><br>
        They’re there to support you and help get you through challenging and frustrating situations whether it be
        through learning or programming, alone or in a team. Values, empathy and self-awareness, help you pick up on
        emotions and how to react to them in a helpful and constructive manner, being aware of yourself and how your
        actions are impacting the people around you. Without these skills you’d often find yourself in a self
        destructive, and frustrated position of constantly hitting a brick wall and only being unable to move around it
        with difficulty. It would also contribute to a higher percentage of people giving up on what they’re trying to
        achieve too.

        <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </strong><br><br>
        That I after a few weeks I already have foundational knowledge to create simple games. I find it incredible the
        games, apps and systems that people can create, and at times it’s mind boggling just how a piece of software was
        created, so much so that it’s in my mind it was indistinguishable from magic. I know on the right track to being
        able to create some awesome apps!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </strong><br><br>
        I found the core blogs a challenge to write. I’m comfortable verbalising my answers however I get stuck when I
        have to write them down on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development Bootcamp course?
        </strong> <br><br>
        Because being good at a job, whether it be programming or anything else isn’t just about being skilled in that
        particular field. Being skilled in a particular field is only a component of the job. There are all these other
        ‘soft skills’ that traditionally have remained unsaid, like understanding who you are, and the strengths and
        weaknesses you bring to the table, or practicing EQ to manage your emotions and effectively work with others.
        These ‘soft skills’ outlined in the core learning, make you a well rounded programmer which separate
        the good programmers from great programmers
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
          that time to practise programming instead?
        </strong><br><br>
        No I don’t think it’s a waste of time. The core learning is there to improve you as a person, a skill which you
        can take into any facet of your life whether it be personal, social, professional or sporting. And I believe
        having these strong ‘soft skills’ further accelerates your ability to learn or progress in whatever you
        experience in life.
