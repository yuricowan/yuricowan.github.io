        <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong><br><br>

        Emotional intelligence or Emotional quotient (EQ) is the ability to use and manage your emotions, communicate
        effectively, empathise with others, and be motivated to achieving goals. EQ are a foundational set of skills,
        useful in all areas of life including your personal, social and professional environments. EQ can be further
        broken down into 5-key elements.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Self-awareness</strong> <br>
        - Knowing how you feel<br>
        - Understanding how your actions affects people around you<br>
        - Being aware of your strengths and weaknesses<br><br>

        <strong>Self-management</strong> <br>
        - Holding yourself accountable <br>
        - Know your values and exhibit them<br>
        - Staying in control of your emotions preventing rushed or emotional decisions that compromise an
        outcome<br><br>

        <strong>Motivation</strong> <br>
        - Being driven to work towards your goals<br>
        - Having an optimistic outlook<br>
        - Be committed through challenging times<br><br>

        <strong>Empathy</strong> <br>
        - The ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes to understand their emotions and perspective<br>
        - Read body language to better understand how someone feels about a situation<br>
        - Respond to other peoples feelings<br><br>

        <strong>Social communication</strong> <br>
        - Communicate clearly and effectively to a group of people<br>
        - Receptive to good and bad news<br>
        - Work through and resolve conflict<br>
        - Give praise to others<br><br>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong><br><br>
        IQ refers to your knowledge, how quickly you can process and retain information to arrive at a definitive
        solution. Whereas EQ is all about how you manage and control your emotions and understand others perspectives.
        There is no definitive solution, instead guidelines on how you should act because of differences in
        individuals
        personalities and nuances to social interactions.
      </p>


      <p>
        <strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>
        It sets a baseline on how we act as individuals, in terms of managing our own emotions and shapes how we’re
        perceived by others through how we act in certain situations impacting our personal and professional
        relationships. This is important because as humans we spend our lives living with emotions and everyday we’re
        faced with social interactions, so why not be aware of yourself and your surroundings to make considered
        decisions.
