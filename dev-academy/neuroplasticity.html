          <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
          Neruo = brain <br>
          plasticity = mouldable <br>
          Neroplasticity = mouldable-brain! <br><br>

          Neuroplasticity is the brains ability, mould and change shape throughout your life. Your brain changes shape
          when you learn something new, practice a new skill, feel an emotion or think in a specific way. It causes
          your
          brains neurones to fire and create new connections within your brain.
          <br><br>
          These connections are like roads, and
          the more traffic is on that road, the wider it gets. When your practice a skill where there are strong
          connections/wide roads, it feels like second nature! Similarly when connections in your brain aren’t being
          used, then the connection/road becomes weaker/narrower. Neruoplasticity is relevant to learning, because if
          we
          want to learn a new skill such as coding and reshape our brain then you need to actively engage in
          practicing
          coding and learning new techniques to strengthen your brains connections until it become second nature.
          <br><br>
          Increase neuroplasticity

          When I learn a new coding concept, I will often read or watch the exact same concept from a different
          article
          or video. Having a concept repeated to you that is worded differently or displayed in another form on a
          video
          helps me increase my neuroplasticity. This is because someone else is further backing up the concept you
          learnt from somewhere else, but they will come at it from a slightly different angle.

          <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
          The belief that your mind can improve through practice, instead of the belief that your skills and ability
          are
          fixed. The growth and fixed mindset can be broken down into components in image on the <strong>left</strong> .
          <br><br>

          A growth mindset is important because it’s a way of teaching your brain to change its natural reaction to
          situations you encounter in life. The ability to react positively to situations that have traditionally been
          seen as negative such as receiving feedback, and to put more effort and persist throughout challenging
          learning.
          <br><br>
          A growth mindset is relevant
          because in this bootcamp we will encounter things we don’t understand, we’ll need to embrace the challenge and
          put
          in the effort to learn, and take feedback from your efforts as an opportunity to grow and develop.
