        <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
        <br>
        Professional: Become a software engineer within blockchain technology, specifically decentralised finance.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have an interest in blockchain technology, because it’s a new and exciting field with potential. Decentralised
        finance is an area within the blockchain space that I would like to pursue because it will reshape the way we do
        finance in the future and it compliments my finance background.
        <br>
        <br>
        Personal: learn other programming languages and set some personal projects such like;
        <br>
        - Self build website from the ground-up capable of e-commerce
        <br>
        - Active aerodynamic wing on a car
        <br>
        - Create software ( using Raspberry pi) which can track data from sensors
        <br>
        - Create a keeper bot to liquidate over collateralised loans

      </p>

        <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning
        </strong>
        <br>
        Strength:

        I’m motivated and driven to pursue and complete goals I set, while striving for a high standard.
        <br>
        <br>
        Limitations
        <br>
        - I don’t often utilise my available time in a productive manner<br>
        - Get distracted with other tasks. Learning from home is new to me, and I need to organise my day so I remain
        productive.<br>
        - I will fill in the workload into the given time, which means I can be unproductive if the workload is
        significantly below the allocated time.<br>
        - I can rush ahead and use the function for its intended purpose without understanding the function/concept
        completely<br>
        - I need to make asking for help a habit when it’s hindering my progress. I don’t have an issue asking for help,
        however it’s different when you’re in a learning from home environment and aren’t surrounded by other students
        and
        teachers
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
          Academy?
        </strong>
        <br>
        Develop communication and teamwork in a coding environment working on projects with peers<br>
        Develop communication skills in translating software functionality in layman’s terms

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong>
        <br>I aim to manage my workload in a structured and consistent manner. During the sprints at home, as a baseline
        I
        set aside Monday to Friday 8am - 5:30pm (and 1 hours practice Saturday and Sunday) to work through the sprint
        using the pomodoro timer, setting myself short breaks throughout the day including lunch. If my workload exceeds
        this allocated time then I will extend my day to meet deadlines.

        When working with other learners, I want to be open and transparent with how I’m progressing on work and make an
        effort to be available throughout the day to work though our project together. The more collaboration with other
        learners the better, I’m really looking forward to peer programming.

        When things build up and get to me, I will communicate my thoughts to my team or facilitators. Being honest and
        upfront about your problem is the best solution and even if it’s not solved immediately ‘a trouble shared is a
        trouble halved’.

        When I’m experiencing a block there are several ways I go about solving it:
        Take a short break
        Google your problem
        Ask the cohort / team member
        Ask a the appropriate discord channel
        Ask a facilitator


      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Expectations from the facilitation team:</strong> Being supportive, patient, and providing honest
        feedback to develop my technical and non-technical skills.


      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scheduling information:</strong> I have no current commitments, however I will begin to block out small
        windows throughout my week so as the work ramps up I have allocated time to leave my computer screen and get
        some exercise to refresh.
